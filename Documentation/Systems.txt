## Introduction
The ScriptableObjectSystem is a ScriptableObject derived class to further inherit from that allows for
ScriptableObjects to receive callbacks from a MonoBehaviour (the CallbackDistributorHost component) in
an active scene.

Since the system's instance and data exists as an asset within the Unity project, modifying both it's
configuration and and 'wiring it up' (referencing it from other assets or MonoBehaviours via drag and
drop) in the editor is very simple and intuitive.

## Script Reference
A ScriptableObjectSystem can be hosted within a CallbackDistributor, setting it's UpdateType flags with
each callback the hosted system wants callbacks for. This allows for processes typically handled by a
MonoBehaviour component attached to a GameObject in a scene, to instead be stored as an asset - improving
visibility across the project.

A derived class can implement any of the following methods, which will be called if the
ScriptableObjectSystem has set the appropriate flag in the RequiresUpdatesOn variable:

	Start() - Called when the CallbackDistributor asset receives the Start() callback.

	Update() - Called when the CallbackDistributor asset receives the Update() callback.

	FixedUpdate() - Called when the CallbackDistributor asset receives the FixedUpdate() callback.

	LateUpdate() - Called when the CallbackDistributor asset receives the LateUpdate() callback.

	OnGUI() - Called when the CallbackDistributor asset receives the OnGUI() callback - useful for immediate
		mode GUI functions, such as displaying debug information, from the ScriptableObjectSystem.

	OnAwake() - Workaround for ScriptableObject.Awake not reliably being called and is called when the 
		CallbackDistributor asset receives the OnAwake callback.

	OnQuit() - Called when the CallbackDistributorHost (MonoBehaviour) component receives the 
		OnApplicationQuit callback.

The individual configuration for callbacks per ScriptableObjectSystem are handled by a flags enum allowing
for callback of any combination of the options available.

enum UpdateType
{ None = 0, Start = 1, Update = 2, FixedUpdate = 4, LateUpdate = 8, OnGUI = 16, OnAwake = 32, OnQuit = 64 }

UpdateType RequiresUpdatesOn
The ScriptableObjectSystem controls which of these callbacks it wants with this variable, and is easily
configured in the Unity editor on the ScriptableObjectSystem asset. 

Adding a ScriptableObjectSystem to the CallbackDistributor asset (the hosted list) will mean that it's 
RequiresUpdatesOn value is evaluated upon receipt of any callback by the CallbackDistributor. This allows 
real-time changes to the callbacks of a ScriptableObjectSystem.

Also to note is that the ScriptableObjectSystems are called in the order they appear in the list in the 
inspector. This list is reorderable in the editor meaning it is possible to control the order any hosted
systems get their callbacks.
